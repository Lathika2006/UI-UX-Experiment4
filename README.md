# UI-UX-Experiment4
Design a wireframe diagram for a generic application or website using Balsamiq.
## Aim:
To design wireframe diagrams for a generic application or website using Balsamiq, incorporating at least five essential screens—Welcome/Splash, 
Login/Signup, Home/Dashboard, Content/Product Listing, and Checkout/Contact/Final Action—to demonstrate basic user flow and interface structure.

## Algorithm:
Step 1: Define the App/Website Purpose
        Choose a general-purpose application or website idea (e.g., e-commerce, food delivery, fitness app, blog).
        Briefly outline key user goals and basic functionalities.

Step 2: Plan the Screen Flow
        Identify and list the 5 essential screens:
        Welcome/Splash Screen
        Login/Signup Screen
        Home/Dashboard Screen
        Content/Product Listing Screen
        Checkout/Contact/Final Action Screen
        Sketch the basic flow of how users will navigate between these screens.

Step 3: Open Balsamiq and Create Wireframes
        Use Balsamiq or any wireframing tool with a low-fidelity approach.
        Screen 1: Welcome/Splas
        Add app name/logo
        Optional loading bar or “Get Started” button

Screen 2: Login/Signup
         Fields for email/username and password
         Buttons for login and sign-up
         Optional: social login options

Screen 3: Home/Dashboard
          Navigation bar (bottom or top)
          Summary of key features (e.g., categories, quick actions)
          User profile or menu access

Screen 4: Content/Product Listing
          Grid or list layout
          Filters/sorting options
          Item previews (image, name, short description)

Screen 5: Checkout/Contact/Final Action
          Final action options (e.g., buy, contact, submit form)
          Payment or confirmation section
          Navigation to return or exit

Step 4: Link Wireframes
        Add navigation arrows/buttons between screens to indicate flow.
        Ensure all screens are accessible and logical from a user journey perspective.

Step 5: Review and Refine
        Check for visual hierarchy, clarity, and completeness.
        Make sure wireframes follow basic UI/UX principles (simplicity, consistency, usability).
        Adjust alignment, spacing, and labeling for clarity.


## Output:
##  Login/Signup Screen
